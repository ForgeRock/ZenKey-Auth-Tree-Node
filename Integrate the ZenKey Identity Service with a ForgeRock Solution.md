# Integrate the ZenKey Identity Service with a ForgeRock Solution

## ZenKey Identity Service Overview

ZenKey Identity Service is a unique, network-based identity solution that relies on data derived from wireless carriers to verify users. It provides a highly secure way for online services to verify their customersâ€™ identities when they login from any mobile device and, lets people easily log into websites. This solution helps eliminate the need to remember, manage or update dozens of usernames and passwords that customers use today to log into web sites.

The ZenKey Identity Service integration with ForgeRock supports primary device flows, and secondary device flows using a browser on a laptop, desktop, or mobile device. For more information about these authentication flows visit [Server and Web Integration Guide](https://developer.myzenkey.com/web).

For information about how to integrate ZenKey into iOS and Android applications, visit the  [ZenKey Developer Resource Site](https://developer.myzenkey.com/).

## PreRequisites for integrating ZenKey and ForgeRock

 - You must have a ForgeRock instance or solution. For more information, see  [Create a New ForgeRock Account](https://backstage.forgerock.com/account/register).
 - You must be registered in the [ZenKey Developer Portal](https://portal.myzenkey.com/login) . Once your company is approved, make note of your client id and client secret. For more information, see the [ZenKey Portal User Guide](https://developer.myzenkey.com/portal/).
 - The wireless carriers must provision your client. Currently, the provisioning step may take a few days, but will be faster in the future.
